> :rocket: Food Commerce project made as part of the Frontend Master course from Dev Samurai.
> Using React, a responsive website was made with the following features:
>   Product Navigation: Users can explore a wide range of food products available for purchase. Each product has a description, price, and image.
>   Shopping Cart: Users can add products to the shopping cart and review their items before checkout.
>   Simple Checkout: The checkout process is streamlined for an efficient shopping experience.
>   Secure Payment: Customers can make payments securely using reliable payment methods.

> The technologies used in the [Frontend](https://github.com/Luc4sf/FoodCommerce) were HTML, CSS, React, TypeScript as well as development plugins like ESLint and Prettier. GitHub Pages was used to host the site and make it accessible on the web.
> It was used the library Axios to make HTTP requests. In the Frontend development (and in the Demo) a json file was used as database.
> For the Backend it was used Docker Desktop, PostgreSQL and Prisma. The payment system was made with Asaas, using Asaas Sandbox as test.

> A demo is available without the Backend implementation.
